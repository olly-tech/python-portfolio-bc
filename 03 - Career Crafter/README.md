# Career Crafter - Validating User Input Program
A program that allows a user to enter their personal information for an application and validates the input against a specific criteria.

## Project Description
This application was created as part of the Hyperion Dev Software Engineering Bootcamp and had the following requirements:
1. Use conditional statements for input validation.
2. Use try-except blocks to gracefully manage unexpected exceptions.
3. Recognise and address various error types, including edge cases.

The program will take input from a user of name, surname, phone number, location, skills and programming languages. It will validate these inputs and clean the data prior to processing. It will handle predictable user errors as well as edge cases. 

As such, this program showcases my knowledge and usage of Python:
- Conditional statements
- Try-Except
- Error Types


## Additional Features
- [ ] Allow users to set up their own application conditions that the applicant's data should adhere to.

# Simple Scribes - Creating and Editing Documents
A program that acts as a simple word processing tool, allowing users to edit and create text.

## Project Description
This application was created as part of the Hyperion Dev Software Engineering Bootcamp. The following features should be offered to the user:
1. Text formatting - allowing user to change text to bold, underlined, italicised and capitalised.
2. Styles - allowing user to have a set style for titles, headings and bodies in the document. 
3. Find and Replace - a tool to let user find specific word or character and replace it with another.

As such, this program showcases my knowledge and usage of Python:
- String Handling and Manipulation
- Formatting Strings for Output
- Built-in Python String Functions
- Lists, List Methods and Nested Lists
- Dictionaries

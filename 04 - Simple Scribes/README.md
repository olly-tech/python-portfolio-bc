# Simple Scribes - Creating and Editing Documents
A program that acts as a simple word processing tool, allowing users to edit and create text.

## Project Description
This application was created as part of the Hyperion Dev Software Engineering Bootcamp. The following features should be offered to the user:
1. Text formatting - allowing user to change text to bold, underlined, italicised and capitalised.
2. Styles - allowing user to have a set style for titles, headings and bodies in the document. 
3. Find and Replace - a tool to let user find specific word or character and replace it with another.

This program will take input from user related to an application form. These inputs will be validated, and cleaned prior to processing. Predictable user errors and edge cases will be handled. The following inputs will be focused on: full name, phone number, email, age.

As such, this program showcases my knowledge and usage of Python:
- String Handling and Manipulation
- Formatting Strings for Output
- Built-in Python String Functions
- Lists, List Methods and Nested Lists
- Dictionaries



## Additional Features and Future Steps
- [ ] Store data in a text file.
- [ ] Improve functionality of find and replace tool for if user is attempting to replace only the nth instance of their 'find' search.

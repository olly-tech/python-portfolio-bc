# Paws n Cart - The Pet Shop Application
A shopping cart application for pet products, allowing a user to edit their cart and checkout with a total cost. 

## Project Description
This application was created as part of the Hyperion Dev Software Engineering Bootcamp and had the following requirements:
1. Create a shopping cart for a user which they can view, using Python String Manipulation.
2. Allow a user to add and remove items from their cart. 
3. Calculate the total cost of the cart when requested.

For this project, I was challenged to use the foundational Python programming I had learnt so far. This meant avoiding usage of lists in favour of string manipulation which provided quite the challenge.

As such, this app showcases my knowledge and usage of Python:
- Control structures
- Operators
- While loops
- User Input and Output
- Variables and Types
- String Manipulation


## Future Features
- [ ] Allow users to change the quantity of each item.
- [ ] Add functionality to your programme that will offer users personalised suggestions, based on products in their cart.
- [x] ~~Create a list of products that will display to the user and users will have to choose items from this list only.~~ (29/11/2023)
